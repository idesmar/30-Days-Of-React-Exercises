# 30 Days of React: Day 06 | Map List Keys

### Dev Notes
* [Personal SCSS Reset](./src/reset.scss) used inspired by [CSS Reset](https://github.com/elad2412/the-new-css-reset) by [@elad2412](https://github.com/elad2412)
* Styling done mostly in .scss (sass folder included has custom mixins and functions)
* Q&A incorporated to CRA page using [lev1qna.js](./src/data/lev1qna.js)
* Started using custom functions *makeID.js* for keys and *utils.js*
