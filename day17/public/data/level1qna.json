      "Link: `Link` is an anchor tag underneath that redirects the user to a different path",
      "NavLink: `NavLink` is like a more customizable `Link`. It allows easy styling because of its built-in active/isActive props",
      "Outlet: `Outlet` allows pages to share a layout",
      "Navigate: `Navigate` or `useNavigate` allows manual navigation to a page without the use of an anchor tag. ie. attaching function from `useNavigate` to a button that when clicked will direct page to previous page; or a `Navigate` element that will direct user to a different page if a certain requirement is not met"
